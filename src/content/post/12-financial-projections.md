## **How to Analyze**
- **Realistic assumptions:** Ensure your assumptions for growth, pricing, and customer acquisition are based on data rather than optimistic predictions. Use a range of projections (base, optimistic, pessimistic).
- **Sensitivity analysis:** Perform sensitivity analysis to show how changes in assumptions (like pricing, costs, or conversion rates) could impact your financial outcomes.
- **Milestones and funding needs:** Link financial projections to specific milestones and funding needs. This helps investors see the capital required at each stage.
