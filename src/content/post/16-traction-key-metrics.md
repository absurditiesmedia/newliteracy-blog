## **What to Include**
The **Traction / Key Metrics** section is vital for showing the progress you've made to date. This demonstrates to investors that there’s real momentum behind your business and that the company has reached a point where scaling is feasible. Metrics help investors evaluate how well the business is performing and its growth potential.

**Core Elements:**
- **Revenue Growth:** If applicable, provide a detailed breakdown of monthly or annual revenue growth, highlighting any significant increases.
- **Customer Acquisition:** Show how customer base is growing—number of users, customers, or clients acquired over time.
- **Retention Metrics:** Key figures on customer retention, such as churn rate, repeat customers, or subscription renewals.
- **Engagement Metrics:** Include data on how users are interacting with the product, like DAUs (Daily Active Users), MAUs (Monthly Active Users), or usage frequency.
- **Sales Pipeline:** If relevant, provide insight into your sales pipeline and any contracts or partnerships in the pipeline.
- **Growth Rate:** Demonstrate the rate at which your business is growing or scaling.
- **Key Partnerships:** Include any major partnerships, customers, or clients secured, and the impact they have on business growth.

## **Where to Source the Information**
- **Internal Data:** Pull information from internal CRM tools, financial data, or analytics platforms like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or your own sales database.
- **Financial Statements:** Use financial records for revenue, growth metrics, and profitability information.
- **Customer Data:** Information from customer surveys, product usage data, or interviews.
- **Market Data:** Industry reports that benchmark your performance against competitors.

## **How to Analyze**
- **Growth Rate:** Analyze the rate of change in key metrics (revenue, customers, etc.) over time. Is your business scaling at the pace expected?
- **Cohort Analysis:** This is especially useful for SaaS businesses or products with recurring revenue. Analyze how different customer cohorts (grouped by acquisition date) perform over time.
- **Conversion Rate:** Look at the conversion rates at different stages of your funnel (lead-to-customer, trial-to-paid, etc.).
- **Unit Economics:** Evaluate metrics like customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), and gross margins to understand how efficiently the business is scaling.

## **Format and Structure**
- **Revenue & Growth Charts:** Include graphs or bar charts that show how your revenue or user base has grown over time (monthly, quarterly).
- **Customer/Engagement Metrics:** Provide charts or tables showing key customer acquisition and retention data.
- **Sales Pipeline Data:** Include a pipeline chart or table showing how much revenue is expected from leads, deals, or customers that are in the process of being converted.
- **Cohort Analysis or Retention Rates:** Visualize retention or cohort performance if applicable.
