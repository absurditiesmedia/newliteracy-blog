## **1. What to Include in the Business Model Section**

This document explains *how your business makes money* and *how you deliver value to your users*. You should include:

- **Revenue Streams** (e.g., subscription, service fees, commissions)
- **Pricing Structure** (fixed, tiered, per-service, etc.)
- **Customer Segments and Target Market**
- **Acquisition Channels** (e.g., paid ads, referral programs, partnerships)
- **Distribution Channels** (e.g., mobile app, web platform, B2B integration)
- **Key Partners** (e.g., payment processors, contractors, suppliers)
- **Cost Structure** (fixed vs. variable costs)
- **Unit Economics** (CPA, LTV, margins)

---

## **2. Where to Source the Information**

- **Your own business plan assumptions**
- **Competitor pricing and monetization models**
- **Customer interviews or surveys**
- **Investor pitch examples in similar markets**
- **Benchmarks from industry reports (e.g., CB Insights, Crunchbase, Statista)**

---

## **3. How to Analyze and Validate**

**a. Revenue Model**
- Write out your assumptions clearly: *e.g., 10% of homeowners use the app once/month at an average of $X/job.*
- Break down each revenue stream and define what drives it (volume x price).
- Consider *recurring* vs. *one-time* revenue.

**b. Customer Acquisition**
- Define acquisition channels and estimate cost per acquisition (CPA).
- Use existing ad cost benchmarks or results from small-scale pilot campaigns.

**c. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**
- Calculate average revenue per customer x average retention period.
- Use this to compare with CPA to ensure sustainability (LTV > 3Ã— CPA is a good benchmark).

**d. Cost Structure**
- Break down your costs into:
  - Fixed (salaries, subscriptions, infrastructure)
  - Variable (marketing, support per user, contractor payouts)

**e. Breakeven**
- Define your monthly burn rate.
- Calculate how many users/revenue needed to break even.

## **4. Recommended Format**

Use a combination of **narrative**, **tables**, and **diagrams**:

### Narrative Summary:
> Our business generates revenue by charging a 10% service fee on completed jobs between homeowners and contractors. Additionally, we offer a premium subscription tier for providers with advanced scheduling and visibility features. Our model is designed to scale with minimal operational overhead.
