*Private Tech Services for Individuals Who Value Clarity, Control, and Discretion*

## What I Do

### Custom Reports & Insights

Get smart, easy-to-digest reports tailored to your interests — real estate trends, stock sentiment, political developments, or niche market research. All backed by data, presented clearly.

### Digital Privacy & Security Checkups

I assess your digital footprint, flag risks, and help you secure personal information before others exploit it. Peace of mind, delivered discreetly.

### Automation & Tech Concierge

Streamline your digital tasks or personal routines with intelligent automations, smart home setup, or even custom tools built just for you. If you can imagine it, I can build it.

### Online Presence Monitoring

I monitor your name, brand, or business across the web and alert you to new mentions or reputational risks. Always be the first to know.

## How It Works

**Step 1:** We start with a short call to discuss your goals and pain points.  
**Step 2:** I deliver a clear proposal with options — no jargon, no guessing.  
**Step 3:** I get to work, and you stay informed with regular, simple updates.
